<!-- # React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project. -->

A Doctor Appointment & Patient Check-In App

## Why Carely?

Every clinic, dentist, hospital, and service provider struggles with the same problem:

Managing patient check-ins and appointments smoothly.

Carely solves this by giving patients, receptionists, providers, and admins the tools they need in a single app.
	1‚Ä¢	Beginner-Friendly Scope: CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) ‚Äì easy to build step by step.

	2‚Ä¢	Perfect for Teamwork: 4 modules for 4 members:

	3‚Ä¢	Frontend ‚Äì Patients: React forms + list page

	4‚Ä¢	Frontend ‚Äì Appointments: Calendar + booking interface 

	5‚Ä¢	Backend ‚Äì Patients API: Express + MongoDB routes

	6‚Ä¢	Backend ‚Äì Appointments API: Check-in logic + scheduling

It‚Äôs realistic, useful, and achievable.

‚∏ª

## MVP 

	1‚Ä¢  Patients can check in using name + DOB or phone

	2‚Ä¢	Confirmation message after check-in

	3‚Ä¢	Reception can:
		- Add a new patient (name, DOB, phone, email)
		- Schedule new appointments
		- View today‚Äôs appointments
		- Mark patients as checked-in
		- Reschedule/cancel appointments

	4‚Ä¢	Providers can:
		- View daily/weekly calendar of appointments
		- See if a patient is checked-in

	5‚Ä¢	Admins can:
		- Create/remove staff & provider accounts
		- Keep system secure
